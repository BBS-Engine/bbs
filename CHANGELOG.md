## BBS 0.1.3

This update features bug fixes and QoL features to film editor.

## BBS 0.1.1

Small BBS Studio update mostly done to film editor.

* Added a feature to insert form property keyframes when holding `Shift + Ctrl` and picking a form property in the preview.
* Added a feature to dope sheet editor to edit a single keyframe channel at the same time by left clicking on hover pencil icon in the left part of the keyframe editor.
